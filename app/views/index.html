        Homes for Ukraine: <br/>Register to host people already living in the UK
      </h1>

      <p>Thanks to the generosity of the British people, over 145,000 people from Ukraine 
        have arrived in the UK and are living safely in their hosts’ homes.</p>

     <p>Many of these guests now need to find a new host while they prepare to live independently, 
        because their original hosts are reaching the end of their 6 month commitment.
      </p>

      <p>Hosts will receive a monthly thank-you payment for providing a home for guests. They 
        will receive £350 a month during the guests’ first 12 months in the UK and £500 a month during their second 12 months.
      </p>

      <p>Guests already living in the UK usually need far less support 
        from their hosts than someone who has just landed in the UK. </p>

      <p>Many guests have already found work and are settling into 
        their local area, making them more self-sufficient.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Check if being a host is right for you
        </h2>
      <p>Hosting people from another country is a big commitment, so we’ve prepared 
        some questions to help you decide if it’s right for you.</p>

      <p>You'll be able to register after you've answered these questions.</p>
