        There are some challenges

      <p>These are some of the challenges hosts may face, so you need to carefully consider:</p>
    

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>covering additional household costs - you receive £350 a month, but isn't always enough</li>
        <li>communicating with guests who don't speak English fluently</li>
        <li>changes in family dynamics</li>
        <li>differences in living habits, including household tasks and eating preferences</li>
        <li>deciding on boundaries and how you want to live together.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your property doesn’t need to meet every requirement.</p>
